# Controls Instructions

This game is only supported on windows for now :-(

-> To jump = ArrowUp
-> To sit = ArrowDown
-> To move forward = ArrowRight
-> To move backward = ArrowLeft
-> To roll/attack = Shift
-> To Dive = ArrowRight + ArrowUp

After collision from an enemy, you can't use controls i.e., you can't move for about 1 second because of dizziness


Feel free to fork and enjoy the Game
